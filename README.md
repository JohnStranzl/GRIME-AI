GRIME AI is an open-source AI framework for the retrieval, automated quality control, and exploratory analysis of ground-based time-lapse imagery. It provides programmatic access to imagery and data products from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), the PhenoCam Network, and the United States Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System (USGS HIVIS), and supports locally stored imagery. Image segmentation using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) isolates ecologically meaningful regions such as vegetation, water, and soil to support feature extraction from user-defined areas.

GRIME AI is developed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in collaboration with Blade Vision Systems, LLC, and is supported by NSF Award 2411065.

## Features

- **Unified data retrieval** from NEON, PhenoCam, and USGS HIVIS repositories through a single graphical interface
- **Automated image triage** using edge-based (Laplacian) and frequency-based (FFT) blur detection, and grayscale intensity-based brightness assessment
- **Qualitative exploration** via animations, composite slice visualizations, and temporal image sequences
- **Quantitative feature extraction** including Shannon entropy, RGB-based greenness indices (GCC, ExG, VARI, GLI), GLCM texture metrics, Gabor filters, Local Binary Patterns, wavelet decomposition, Fourier analysis, Laws texture energy maps, and HSV color descriptors
- **Deep learning-based segmentation** using SAM 2 for precise, reproducible isolation of target features across large image collections
- **Command-line interface** (`GRIME_AI_segment.py`) supporting `--image` and `--folder` flags for batch segmentation workflows
- **Cross-platform** operation on Windows, Linux, and Linux-derived operating systems including HPC clusters and browser-based environments such as Open OnDemand (OOD)
- **FAIR-aligned** outputs in standard CSV and image formats compatible with spreadsheet software and downstream analysis pipelines

## Installation

### Option 1: Conda (Recommended)

The Conda package bundles all required dependencies and ensures a consistent runtime environment across supported operating systems.

```bash
conda install grimelab::grime-ai
```

### Option 2: pip

```bash
pip install grime-ai
```

### Option 3: Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnStranzl/GRIME-AI.git
cd GRIME-AI
pip install -e .
```

> **Note:** Python 3.11 is required. The Conda installation method is strongly recommended as it resolves all dependencies automatically, including PyTorch and SAM 2 model dependencies. Manual installation via pip or from source may require additional configuration steps described in the [project Wiki](https://github.com/JohnStranzl/GRIME-AI/wiki).

---

## Development Setup

GRIME AI is developed using **Python 3.11**, **PyCharm**, and **Qt Creator**. These are the supported and tested development tools. Developers choosing alternative tools (e.g., VS Code) are responsible for configuring their own environment accordingly.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- PyCharm (Community or Professional)
- Qt Creator (for UI file editing)
- Conda (recommended for dependency management)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnStranzl/GRIME-AI.git
cd GRIME-AI
```

2. **Create and activate a Conda environment**

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate grime-ai
```

3. **Open the project in PyCharm**

   - Open PyCharm and select **File > Open**, then navigate to the cloned repository root.
   - Configure the Python interpreter to use the `grime-ai` Conda environment: **File > Settings > Project > Python Interpreter**.

4. **Edit UI files with Qt Creator**

   - `.ui` files are located in the project UI directory.
   - Open Qt Creator and load the desired `.ui` file for layout editing.
   - **Important:** Always edit `.ui` files directly. Never edit the compiled `_ui.py` files generated from them, as these are overwritten during the build process.

5. **Run the application**

```bash
python GRIME_AI.py
```

### PyTorch and GPU Support

GRIME AI uses SAM 2 for image segmentation, which requires PyTorch. GPU acceleration is supported on CUDA-compatible hardware.

> **Important:** PyTorch 2.5 or earlier is required for compatibility with Pascal architecture GPUs (sm 6.0, e.g., GTX 1080). PyTorch 2.8 and later dropped sm 6.0 support. Pin your PyTorch version accordingly:

```bash
conda install pytorch<2.5 cudatoolkit -c pytorch
```

CPU-only operation is supported but will be significantly slower for segmentation tasks.

## Usage

### Graphical Interface

Launch the GRIME AI desktop application:

```bash
python GRIME_AI.py
```

The graphical interface provides access to all GRIME AI capabilities organized around the six-step data science process:

- **Retrieve Data** — Download imagery and data products from NEON, PhenoCam, or USGS HIVIS, or load locally stored imagery
- **Prepare Data** — Run automated image triage to detect and sequester blurry or poorly exposed images
- **Explore Data** — Generate composite slices, animations, and quantitative feature extractions from user-defined regions of interest

### Command-Line Segmentation Interface

For batch segmentation workflows:

```bash
# Segment a single image
python GRIME_AI_segment.py --image path/to/image.jpg

# Segment all images in a folder
python GRIME_AI_segment.py --folder path/to/folder
```

Import the segmentation interface programmatically:

```python
from GRIME_AI.GRIME_AI_segment import run_sam2, run_segformer
```

> **Note:** The correct import path is `GRIME_AI.GRIME_AI_segment`, not `grime_ai_segment`.

### SAGE Annotation Tool

GRIME AI includes the SAGE (Segmentation Annotation and Ground-truth Editor) tool for creating and managing training annotations. SAGE supports:

- Edge Trace Mode with live overlays
- Label Manager with persistent label classes and CSV import/export
- Click-to-activate workflow with zoom and pan controls
